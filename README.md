# Classification_flights
A machine learning classification project

We have information about the flying aircrafts, namely radar measurements and other information provided by the planes themselves about their position, as well as some of their characteristics. With this information we can predict by supervided learning the class of flying aircrafts is an specific example.

The two principal component of the code are the extractor that do the feature engineering and the classifier. In this code I proved two classifier: RandomForest and Xgboost. Finally, the two classifier are overfited and none gives a good enough result. Given the complexity of the data, it is necessary to evaluate other classifiers
